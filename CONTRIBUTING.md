## Development Setup

If you're interested in setting up the project for development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JamesUdy/To-Do-Sentinel.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd To-Do-Sentinel
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Obtain your Firebase configuration object (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, appId).
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Firebase configuration:

     ```env
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
     ```

   Make sure to replace `your-api-key`, `your-auth-domain`, and other placeholders with your actual Firebase configuration values.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
